		<h1>Deyan Vitanov</h1>
		<h2>Entrepreneur | Advisor | Speaker | Author</h2>
		
		<p>
			I am a serial entrepreneur currently serving as the CEO and Co-Founder 
			of Chobolabs, a mobile eSports company.
			Previously, I co-founded Philanthropedia (acquired in 2011) and 
			CPP-Home (acquired in 2003).
		</p>
		<p>
			My passion for building things started at the age of nine when my dad first
			bought me a computer. Fascinated by the endless possibilities, I focused on 
			programming, reverse engineering, and participating in coding competitions, 
			even having the good fortune to win a few.
		</p>	
		<p>
			That is why I felt right at home when I moved to Silicon Valley,
			the epicenter of technological entrepreneurship. 
			I completed my MBA at Stanford, where I co-chaired the Entrepreneurship 
			Conference and taught the "Leadership Labs" class. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have continued my community involvement serving as an advisor at 
			Stanford Ignite, StartX, and Innovation Endeavors among others.
			It has been my privilege to help 100+ entrepreneurs, 
			who have raised $300M+ in funding and employ thousands of people.
		</p>
		<p>
			I regularly speak about entrepreneurship, technology, and leadership
			at conferences, communities, and schools, including Stanford and Berkeley. 
			My spare time is spent reading, meditating, working out, 
			watching StarCraft II eSport tournaments, and petting any dog in sight.
