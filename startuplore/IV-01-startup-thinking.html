<b>Summary:</b> Startup thinking emphasizes (1) hypothesis-driven, data-heavy iterative learning; 
(2) customer focus; (3) speed and agility; (4) 80/20 tradeoffs; (5) scrappiness.</p>
</div>

<div class="main">

	<p>Achieving product/market fit is the ultimate goal of all new ventures. Accomplishing that goal requires a unique mentality, which 
	reflects the <a href="II-02-two-defining-features-of-startups.html">defining features of startups</a>. That mentality is what I call startup thinking. 
	<span class="footnote">[<a href="#end">1</a>]</span></p>
	
	<p>Startup thinking is made up of 5 key principles:</p>
	
	<ul>
	
	<p><li><b>Hypothesis-driven, data-heavy iterative learning</b> - since startups don't know who 
	their customers are and what product they are selling, performing iterative experiments is a 
	matter of survival and the only way to success. Therefore, constructing, executing, and learning 
	from experiments needs to be deliberate, thoughtful, and useful. Good experiments are characterized 
	by clearly formulated hypotheses and focus on collecting high quality and relevant data.</li></p>
	
	<p><li><b>Customer focus</b> - as Steve Blank likes to say, 
	<a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/09/03/the-customer-development-manifesto-reasons-for-the-revolution-part-2/">"in a startup no facts exist inside the 
	building - only opinions."</a> That is why, obsessing about learning from customers is absolutely crucial for startup success.</li></p>
	
	<p><li><b>Speed and agility</b> - startups learn by iterating <a href="II-04-startup-management.html">continuously</a>.
	Therefore, the faster you can go through experiments, the higher the chance to be successful.
	What is more, startups operate in highly uncertain environments, which
	means that agile organizations have a significant advantage, because they can change
	direction without losing pace.</li></p>
	
	<p><li><b>80/20-based tradeoffs (Pareto principle)</b> - the old adage that 
		 <a href="http://www.famous-quotes.net/Quote.aspx?The_perfect_is_the_enemy_of_the_good">perfection is the enemy of progress</a>
		 is very true for new ventures. Because startups are very resource constrained, 
		it is absolutely crucial to find the few things that really matter and focus on excelling at them. The alternative is to try and do everything well, which often
		results in being mediocre across the board.
		For instance, creating many good enough tests rather than few perfect experiments is key to survival 
		in the resource-constrained startup environment.</li></p>
	
	<p><li><b>Scrappiness</b> - cash and time are precious at startups and should be spent very carefully.
	Finding a shortcut that helps you to learn a lot cheaply gives you a tremendous advantage.
	</li></p>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>Next, I explore technology adoption, which is a particularly important topic to know a bit about as you search for product/market fit.</p>

			<p>[1] I have borrowed the "thinking" terminology from design thinking, which was 
			introduced to me by Terry Winograd, Hasso Plattner, and David Kelley. Design 
			thinking emphasizes that anyone can be creative, if they adopt the right mindset and 
			manage the design process carefully. I would similarly argue that anyone can be entrepreneurial
			and the Startup Lore is an attempt to demystify the startup process and outline the entrepreneurial 
			mindset that ultimately leads to successful new ventures.</p>
			
			<p>Interestingly, startup thinking is in a way the unique marriage of design and 
			analytical thinking - because entrepreneurs need to be very resourceful and creative 
			to come up with attractive alternatives, and then they need to be very analytical and 
			disciplined in order to make the right decisions.</p>
